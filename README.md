# light-intensity-logger
This project aims to measure ambient light intensity. The provided Python script is a light intensity logger using a webcam and OpenCV for capturing video frames. It calculates the average light intensity in each frame, plots the intensity values over time using Matplotlib, and displays the video feed with the average intensity value.
The script continuously logs the light intensity readings over time and visualizes the data using Matplotlib to create a graph.
